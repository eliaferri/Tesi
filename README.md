# Quick start


## Running locally.

1. First, install the companion tiling library.

```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/bmschmidt/quadfeather
```

2. Paste your CSV files in the ```data``` folder.

3. Prepare your data for deepscatter by running the following python scripts:

```sh
python3  parse_data_for_deepscatter.py
python3  keyword_to_geojson.py
quadfeather --files publications_for_deepscatter.csv --tile_size 50000 --destination tiles
```

4. Then setup this library to run. It will start a local dev server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

5. If you go to `localhost:3344`, you should see an interactive scatterplot. To dig into what you're seeing, open `index.html`.
